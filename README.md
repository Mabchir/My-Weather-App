# My-Weather-App
SheCodes - Project 

This is a comprehensive project within the scope of SheCodes Bootcamp. 
The purpose of this project was to build a weather web app using HTML, CSS, and JAVA Script. 


What does this Weather App do: 
- Displays current and predicted hourly weather conditions within a specific city/location. 
- Allows the user to input any city in the world 
- Allows the user to see the weather in his specific location 
- Displays changing beautiful emojis related to the weather condition. 

In this project I learned the following: 
- How to use Boostrap to include beautifully designed elements 
- How to use Javascript to add a more interactive and responsive aspect to the application 
- How to use Github and Netlify to work on a programming project and share its frontend and backend code.
- How to use Visual Studio Code in a more efficient way 
- Understand how to interact with public API and retrieve data from openweather API.
